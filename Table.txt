Simple Table:

Elements in use: <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>.

    To create a simple table first you need to use the table element(<table>) and nest any other table elements in it.
    In this case, for a simple table we will create 3 rows and to do that we need to open 3 table row elements(<tr>).
    Inside the first <tr> we will open 3 table headers(<th>). 
    For the other 2 <tr>'s we will open 3 table data elements(<td>) each. 
    These table data will be put on the table in the order it is written.

    To make the tables more understandable you can add borders or anything else with CSS.
