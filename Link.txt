Simple Linking:

Elements in use: <a>, href.

    To link an element such as a <div>, <img> etc., you have to nest these elements inside an anchor element(<a>).
    Whatever you want to link your element to just open a href="" attribute inside the first starting anchor tag and
    add any link you would like into the href attribute. If you want to use an empty href that leads to nowhere use href"#".
